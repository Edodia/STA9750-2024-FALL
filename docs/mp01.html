<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Public transit is a critical component of urban infrastructure, providing millions of people with essential access to work, education, and other services. As a native New Yorker this report is of great interest to me as all of my life I have been dependent on public transportation. This report will provide an analysis of transit data including expenses, ridership totals, and revenue.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This was an interesting project that gave me a view into other transit systems outside of NYC’s MTA system. It is almost clear that the Altoona Metro Transit system is the best when it comes to managing their financials however, credit should be given to the MTA for the fact that they are able to handle the the highest number of riders in the US. If the MTA is capable of handling their problem with fare evasion, their fare recovery could match or exceed Altoona.</p>
